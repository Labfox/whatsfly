## Install

```bash
pip install whatsfly-Labfox
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example to get you started with WhatsFly. This code demonstrates how to send a message and listen for incoming messages using WhatsFly.

### Code

```python
from whatsfly import WhatsApp # May take some time or throw an exception
import time
import pprint

def my_event_callback(whatsapp, event_data):
    ''' 
    Simple event callback to listen to incoming events/messages. 
    Whenever this function is called, it will retrieve the current incoming event or messages.
    '''
    pprint.pprint("Received event data:", event_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    phone = "6283139750000" # Make sure to attach country code + phone number
    message = "Hello World!"

    whatsapp = WhatsApp(on_event=my_event_callback) # The client object

    whatsapp.connect() # Will print a QR Code to the terminal

    message_sent = whatsapp.sendMessage(phone, message, False)
    
    time.sleep(5 * 60)  # Listen for messages for 5 minutes

    whatsapp.disconnect()
```

Warning: The first time you will start the library, and once every month, Whatsfly will download the binaries from Github. You can disable this beahivor by setting the `WHATSFLY_NO_UPDATES` environment variable.
